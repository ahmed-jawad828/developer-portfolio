        description: "At Guest Guru, I led the end-to-end integration of leading property-management systems like Guesty, Hostaway, Zeevou, Tokeet, and OwnerRez—while designing a consolidated property data schema that streamlined onboarding across platforms. I introduced escalation workflows so hosts can resolve issues faster, rolled out a tiered-pricing model to match diverse business needs, and built a unified inbox that merges guest messages from every channel. To tie it all together, I delivered a smooth, intuitive UI that makes managing property details effortless for hosts of any scale",

I automated cross-platform actions with a custom Zapier workflow, integrated Stripe to track monthly recurring revenue, and launched an analytics dashboard for real-time insights. Beyond shipping features, I helped stand up the back-office stack and handled user feedback, swiftly squashing staging and production bugs to keep releases smooth.',
